# What's for Dinner?
![Alt text](Whats-for-Dinner.gif)
## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
This application attempts to pick either a side, main dish, dessert, or all three option together from a set of three arrays. The meal presented can be cleared by pressing the "clear" button. 

### Installation Instructions:
Download the github file to your local host. Once cloned, open the file in VScode and press Port:5500 on the bottom right of your screen. This should launch the application on your computer. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
I was only able dedicate a total of 25 hours on this project. Priorities towards other commitments left me with less than satisfactory results.

### Learning Goals:
My learning goals were to better understand how the DOM works in connecting html, css, and javascript together and attempt to recreate the website presented. I was confident in my CSS construction, but how it connected to everything else still caused confusion. 

### Wins + Challenges:
I discovered I had an initial gross misunderstanding of CSS and html. Most of the work time was spent trying to relearn CSS and html to discover what my mistakes were. It turned out all of my misconceptions weren't far off from what they were supposed to be. But, they were enough to through my entire project sideways and leave me feeling in the dark. By late Saturday night, I was able to discover my main issue was that I had either the wrong html element present in my html, or too many classes listed within those elements. So different classes were overriding other classes unintentionally when I tried to implement them into my CSS. I eventually was able to simplify my html and add the right elements. Removing a few elements, replacing them with mostly section elements to correctly break up my code and use those as the class that would affect the whole block in the CSS. The only exception being the main element in my case. This has left me with little time for the JavaScript to be completed and left much of it still broken and in one case the CSS. I could not get the "cookpot" image to appear. Overall, this project is a failure in completion as well as having a complete omission of any branch creation. But, I did learn much. Including more CSS properties than I imagined possible. Overall, I see no wins in this project for myself. I hold myself to a higher standard than this and will come back to this project at a later date to make it as it should. I'll have to take these lessons and apply them more apptly in the future.
